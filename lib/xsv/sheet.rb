module Xsv
  # Sheet represents a single worksheet from a workbook and is normally accessed through {Workbook#sheets}
  #
  # Xsv is designed for worksheets with a single table of data, optionally with a header row. Because sheet implements
  # {Enumerable} the rows in the worksheet can be iterated over using methods such as `#each` and `#map`
  #
  # By default Sheet will return rows as arrays. But by calling the {#parse_headers!} method the first row of the sheet
  # will be parsed and Sheet will switch to hash mode, returning each row as a hash with the values from the first
  # row as keys.
  #
  # If the sheet contains leading data before the first row of data or the header row, this can be skipped by setting the
  # {row_skip} attribute.
