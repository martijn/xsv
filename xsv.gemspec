                            Xsv is a fast, lightweight parser for Office Open XML spreadsheet files
                            (commonly known as Excel or .xlsx files). It strives to be minimal in the
                            sense that it provides nothing a CSV reader wouldn't, meaning it only
                            deals with minimal formatting and cannot create or modify documents.
